I'll keep this short, mostly because I just need to have something here in order to get everything set up properly.

This is Cobalt's blog! As of right now, it's implemented with [Astro](https://astro.build), and these posts are written using Astro's MDX extension. The files themselves are hosted at [cobalt-language/blog](https://github.com/cobalt-language/blog).

This blog will be used for ideas in development, and if possible, community feedback. If you're reading this and there's a comment section below, please comment, we'd love to hear your thoughts!
